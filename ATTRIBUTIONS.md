# Attributions

We have leveraged existing circuits for some parts of this repository:

1. RSA Signature Verification: See `circuits/helpers/rsa/README.md`.

2. Some helper functions (in `sha256.circom` and `strings.circom`) were inspired from this [repo](https://github.com/TheFrozenFire/snark-jwt-verify) although they were significantly modified.
